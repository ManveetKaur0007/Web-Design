<h2>My Art Gallery</h2>
<p>I will either bring out my sketching notepad or
    canvas or start drawing when I am free or if I am anxious. 
    Drawing is important for our cognitive growth. It can assist 
    us in learning to write and think creatively, as well as developing 
    hand-eye coordination, sharpening analytic abilities, and conceptualising concepts. 
    The table below lists all of my previous artwork as well as photos of my work. </p>

    <h2>Swan</h2>
    <p>I stumbled discovered this drawing while browsing Pinterest.
        Swans symbolise elegance, beauty, love, trust, and loyalty.
        Swans are also associated with inner beauty and self-love.<br/>

    <h2>Fishes in the pond</h2>
    <p>The higher-self, sentiments, and impulses are represented by fish. 
        It's also a metaphor for higher levels of consciousness, as well as 
        intelligence and cognition.<br/>

    <h2>A broken girl</h2>
    <p>To me, this drawing has a great deal of significance. Even when we are damaged,
        we lose faith in others and believe the universe is conspiring against us. 
        Everyone possesses this aura that reminds individuals that the greatest is yet to come.<br/>
