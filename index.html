    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <h3>Laying Plans</h3>
    <p>1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.<br/><br/>
        2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no
        account be neglected.<br/><br/>

        3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when
        seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.<br/><br/>

        4. These are: 
        <ul>
            <li>the Moral Law;</li>
            <li>Heaven;</li> 
            <li>Earth;</li>
            <li>the Commander;</li> 
            <li>method and discipline.</li>
        </ul>
        5. The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless
        of their lives, undismayed by any danger.</p>


    <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
    <h3>Waging War</h3>    
    <p>1. Sun Tzu said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field a thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots,
        and a hundred thousand mail-clad soldiers, with provisions enough to carry them a thousand Li, the expenditure
        at home and at the front, including entertainment of guests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums
        spent on chariots and armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per day. Such is the cost of
        raising an army of 100,000 men.<br/><br/>
        
        2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long incoming, then men's weapons will grow dull and their ardour
        will be damped. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.<br/><br/>
        
        3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain.<br/><br/>

        4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength exhausted and your treasure
        spent, other chieftains will spring up to take advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be able
        to avert the consequences that must ensue.<br/><br/>

        5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has never been seen associated with long delays.</p>
